            <hr>
            <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Our campus was established in March 2004</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">ISL is located on protected woodland and housed in purpose-built facilities in its own
                grounds. The building was designed in the 1970s as a French middle school, with light and spacious rooms
                grouped in clusters around a central atrium.
                Primary and Secondary school each have their own area, but share the library and the art and music
                rooms. As well as taking place in the gym, many of our sports activities take place outdoors in a local
                stadium or in the state-of-the-art gym and swimming pool of the neighbouring districts. Our outdoor
                premises include a large upper playground, a multi-sport astro-turf playing field and a small
                amphitheatre.
                The building, which is rented from local city authorities (La Métropole), was designed in the 1970's as
                a French middle school (11-16 year olds) and includes light and spacious class and work rooms grouped in
                clusters over 6 half-floors. There are dedicated facilities for art and design, music and movement and
                ICT, a large, well-equipped library and a small gym for primary school P.E. and Enrichment Activities.
                Our outdoor premises include a primary playground, a new multi-sports astro-turf playing field, a small
                amphitheatre and attractive grassed areas. The older children have access to various municipal playing
                fields, an athletics stadium and a large state-of-the-art gymnasium nearby for their sports lessons. We
                are also usually able to offer swimming sessions to some of our younger primary students in a nearby
                municipal pool.</p>

                <p> Students from Grades 5-9 participated in ISL's annual Poetry Slam, in which they performed poetry
                    before judges and peers in order to select the top “performers” from each class.But the Poetry Slam
                    is much more than a competition. It is a week when students are encouraged to not only write poems,
                    but also to share their feelings, impressions and ideas through poetry. There are magical moments
                    during the Poetry Slam when the student-poet creates images and evokes
                    feelings in the audience. Somehow this comes about through a certain combination of words and
                    phrases and just as importantly, through the poet's sincere expression of those words. During this
                    week, windows into the hearts and souls of the students are opened, if only briefly. Ultimately, the
                    goals of the Poetry Slam are to demystify poetry, to distance it from a studied analysis of poetry
                    and to help students recognize and release the poet inside themselves.</p>

                <p> Almost every year there is a summer fete and students are invited to the school for about 1 hour but
                    due to covid-19 we are not able to do the summmer fete for the last almost 3 years. In
                    the sumer fete there is activities like you could get a free watch or win a netendo but these
                    actvities are prepared befour the summer fete and if you want to win all you need is a bit money
                    like 1 euro. The activity workes like this: You pay the amount that is needed and my put your name

                    IB World School situated in a pleasant suburb just a short drive or bus journey away from the centre
                    of the beautiful city of Lyon, recently voted the second best place to live and work in France in a
                    national newspaper survey. Founded in 2004, ISL, an independent school offering the only full
                    English-medium curriculum in Lyon, continues to grow and flourish. We value diversity (over 330 students aged 3-18 of 47
                    different nationalities) and cultivate inclusion through holistic, student-centred programmes of
                    study that balances academic success with individual growth and fulfilment. The school is housed in
                    a purpose-built building in its own green and spacious grounds and is at present in the final stages
                    of an extensive refurbishment project to enhance the premises and improve our students' learning.
                    Family backgrounds and commitments mean we have long-term students alongside those here on a
                    shorter-term basis, but the lifelong friendships that students make with each other help carry them
                    through the transitions of their education into the globalised world an IB education prepares them
                    so well for. The school's vision, Building Our Best Selves, is the embodiment of our philosophy, be
                    it in academics with excellent external examination results in IB DP and IGCSE, in personal
                    development through the IB Learner Profile and in internationally-minded human interaction and
                    relationships, so essential to self-improvement and readiness for today's complex world. Staff in
                    ISL are passionate, highly qualified and experienced practitioners who enjoy the sharing of
                    good practice within a culture of ongoing professional development. The combined satisfaction of
                    working in a safe and nurturing educational environment and the Lyonnais life-style makes for a very
                    stable team in general, with turnover well under average for an international setting. Teachers work
                    closely with parents to support student needs and the Parent Teacher Association in turn shows
                    boundless energy and dedication in its support of the school and its different communities and
                    activities. ISL highly values its close working partnership with parents in general. Indeed,
                    community and family are integral to our success as we live, grow and learn together. As you browse the pages of
                    our website, I hope you get a deeper feel for what I have summed up very briefly above. I myself feel privileged and lucky to 
                    lead such a happy and successful school and would love to show you round. In-person visits can be arranged with the office but in the meantime,
                    please join me on a virtual tour of our campus. I hope to meet you and your children very soon!</p>
